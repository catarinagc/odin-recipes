Project 1-recipes:

This is a project from The Odin Project, it is a basic recipe website using only the html knowledge learned from TOP so far

After finishing it I consider that this was a very usefull project for my learning, it helped me consolidate what I had learned about html and also served as a good oportunity to experiment with git and github
